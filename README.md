# Kosaraju-s-algorithm-Iterative-

Iterative implementation of Kosaraju's algorithm (works on relatively big graphs):

- DFS on reversed graph (for magic order of nodes, so that the SCCs have some key property)
- DFS on original graph in decreasing order (where the order is obtain from 1st pass)

The algorithm outputs the SCCs of the original graph.
